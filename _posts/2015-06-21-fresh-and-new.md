Quite some time has passed now. Apparently I am not the every week, day-to-day blogger and choosing Wordpress as the back end was way overkill. It was quite an ordeal to finally creating a post and the load time, do not make me start.
I am partly to blame for not optimizing it enough and maybe even using it wrong but I dunno, it just felt clunky all the way and did not work for me.

#### New Back End

So I decided to redesign and re-imagine, one could say, the website.  
Instead of using Wordpress and deal with databases, security leaks, long loading times and much more I chose a static site generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Do not get me wrong, Wordpress is great if you need all the stuff it has to offer, which I do not. I need a simple site, fast and reliable.
Speaking of static sites, there are a quite a few static-site generators out in the wild (e.g. [Middlemann](https://middlemanapp.com/), [Nanoc](http://nanoc.ws/)).  
I chose Jekyll for two reasons: I like the integration with GitHub Pages, having a backup of the site is nice. I also found this awesome theme you can see, made by [Hossain Mohd Faysal](http://www.hossainmohdfaysal.com/Notepad/).
I did adjust a few things and changed a little here and there (and learned the basics of HTML and CSS in the process!), but without his basis this site would look just awful. Many kudos to him!  
The other two I mentioned are looking like the better solution for non-programmers, but as this was not a problem for me I just stuck with Jekyll and did not read hours and hours of experience reports.

#### New Content

But the changes are not only under the hood and the visual. Instead of this being mainly a blog I converted the site to be mainly my personal homepage, my presence in the Wold Wide Web. The blog itself will not be deleted, the old post are still reachable, but new post every now and then will be more technical, with the exception of maybe recipes.  
This are the two main reasons I switched the language to English. It is a more suitable option for a personal website and technical articles.  
Posts and pages are now a simple markdown file combined with HTML, if needed. I can use my favorite editor making writing really smooth and nice.  
Furthermore, I disabled comments. Having a comment system on a static site is doable, but comes with a little bit of a hassle. The easy solution, just using [disqus](https://disqus.com/), is not perfect from a privacy protection point of view. Thus I disabled comments altogether. If somebody wants to comment, one can always write me an [email](mailto:askeme@pgunited.com?subject=comments_freshAndNew) and I can add the comment to the post, if desirable.

#### New Logo

Last but not least, I got a logo, finally!
<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/elements/logo.png" alt="PG United Logo" />
  <figcaption>PG United, my personal logo </figcaption>
</figure>

My new personal logo combines a few elements which are part of me and my personality.
The color red, my all time favorite, as a circle, like the circle on the Japanese flag. Combined with cat ears, also in red, as not only a symbol of cats, but also of the playfulness I try to live by every day. Then the *P* and *G*, the *P* mirrored  and deformed, as symbol of breaking the habits, striving against the stream.
Inside the letters, buttons and a directional pad, not only meaning games and game development, but also seeing life as a game, playing it every day, trying to improve.  
To put it in a nutshell, I love it. Big thanks to Pia Bsdurrek for coming up with the design and making it!

So much for the new things. Starting from today, the occasional blog post will be in English and mostly technical. I hope you will still enjoy it just like the rest.  
...One last change: the URL is now different too: [www.pgunited.COM](http://www.pgunited.com).

Got any thoughts or comments on this? I would like to hear them! Just write me an [email](mailto:askeme@pgunited.com?subject=comments_freshAndNew).
