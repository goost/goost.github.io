**Gleb Ostrowski** (occasionally nicknamed *goost*), Applied Computer Science, B. Sc (starting from September), currently living in Hanover, Germany.  
This is I.  
Officially, my job is to be agile, compose systems and architecture, seek patterns, invent patterns, implement those, debug them, test them and go on bug hunting.  
Never forget the bug hunting.  
But really?  
I build little pieces of art, much like an artist and an architect, with my own two hands.  
Which really means, I create something out of nowhere.  

I wish for my creations to not only surround one, not only please the eye (hopefully!), but also lessen the daily burden on one's shoulder.  
Be it because the tool simplifies the daily work.  
Be it because the game refreshes one's energy.  
Basically it is all about creating art, software, which is seen and used by others.  
My art is seldom done alone thus the beauty I strive for does not only lie in what the user sees, but also in the parts which my coworkers are dealing with. Namely the code, the very foundation of everything.  
**In the end of the day, we create worlds.**  
Worlds for people to dive in, beautiful worlds, dirty worlds, worlds to help people, entertain people, show people something new and unexpected.
Small worlds or big worlds.  
Worlds for many, worlds for few.  
Interested in creating worlds together?
Shoot me an [email](mailto:goost@pgunited.com).  
Need more facts? See here my [resume]({{ site.url }}/resume.pdf).

In my free time I like to surf around the web, watch [Extra Credits](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg), random [TED talks](https://www.ted.com) and other.
And reading a book or articles about geeky stuff, technical stuff or just pure fantasy.  
If I get tired of reading, I also enjoy playing games, which could involve even more reading, but well, it is interactive<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.  
Last, but certainty not least, I love anime and manga. 
After my study abroad in Japan it only intensified.
Speaking of which, I also study Japanese.
Still nowhere where I want to be, but then their would be no point in studying, would it?

One dream of mine is to finally adopt my own two cats. 
My mother was allergic, and during my studies I shared a flat with others. Sadly, no cats in this circumstances.  
[But cats are just so adorable, aren't they?](http://www.google.com/images?q=cats)

##### Why PG United? 

My name is not easily understood and therefore a poor fit
for a catchy homepage URL. One of those days, you know, when enlightenment strikes you, I got the idea for PG United (with the help of my dear fellow student Philip Sauer).  
What does the *P* and *G* stand for, you ask?  
The trick is, it depends on the situation.
Working on different projects means, among other thing, to deal with new challenges, redefine one's knowledge, expand one's skill set.  
Whatever need may arise in a given situation, I know that I can adapt to it quickly. *P* and *G* stand as a symbol for this adaptivity, changing their meaning based on the circumstances, never getting old.  
And because old skills and meanings are not getting worthless, they are *united* together with the new ones, forming myself in the end.
