Gleb Ostrowski, Applied Computer Science, Bachelor of Science.  
This is me.  
Officially, my job is to be agile, compose systems and architecture, seek patterns, invent patterns, implement those, debug them, test them and go on bug hunting. Never forget the bug hunting.  
But really? I build little pieces of art, much like an artist and an architect, with my own two hands.  
Which really means, I create something out of nowhere.   
I wish for my creations to not only surround one, not only please the eye (hopefully!), but also lessen the daily burden on ones shoulder.  
Be it, because the tool simplifies the daily work.  
Be it, because the game refreshes one energy.  
Basically? It is all about creating art, software, which is seen and used by others.  
My art is seldom done alone, thus the beauty I strive for does not only lie in what the user sees, but also in the parts which my coworkers are dealing with. Namely the code, the very foundation of everything.  
In the end of the day, we create worlds.  
Worlds, with beauty on the inside, with beauty on the outside, worlds for people to dive in, forget about the other world, worlds to help people, entertain people, show people something new and unexpected.
Complicated worlds, simple worlds, small worlds, big worlds.  
Worlds for many, worlds for few.  
Interested in creating worlds together?
